	<p>Data Request Regarding Investigations of Union Officials</p>
</div>
	<p>The Union was informed of an ongoing investigation by the Human Resources Manager into Union Officials and their utilization of Official Time. In an effort to obtain evidence of this unauthorized inquiry, the Union formally requested information through a data request. Unfortunately, the Union's access to any potentially damaging information related to the Human Resources Manager was denied.</p>

		<p>Reinstating Mandate Passes</p>
	</div>

	<p>GS-8 officers are currently experiencing mandatory overtime, due to officers covering the activities Lieutenant position. Notably, certain staff members have opted to utilize passes as a means to circumvent these mandated obligations. This situation raises substantial concerns within the Union, particularly in light of reports indicating a deviation from the Labor-Management Relations (LMR) agreement. Specifically, the refusal to reinstate staff members utilizing passes is inconsistent with established protocols.</p>

		<p>Union Animus</p>
</div>
	<p>Reported concerns encompass the withholding of Official Time, instances of Union retaliation, the unequal allocation of Union members' days off, and the use of derogatory language targeting Union members, specifically referncing them as "Jews". These matters underscore the need for the Union to advocate for fair treatment, respectful working conditions, and adherence to established protocols during discussions with the agency.</p>

		<p>Data Request for OIA Referrals for Investigation</p>
</div>
	<p>The Union formally requested comprehensive documentation of all Office of Internal Affairs (OIA) referrals for both bargaining and non-bargaining staff. The purpose is to investigate and mitigate potential favoritism disparities between the two groups. Regrettably, the agency declined to provide any requested information, despite the Union referencing a prior ruling affirming their entitlement to such data.</p>

		<p>Bad Faith Bargaining</p>
</div>
	<p>The Union has chosen to file on various issues, including bad faith bargaining, non-compliance with agreements on harassment, agency violation of the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) for member's dues cancellation, incomplete data request results regarding Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs), discrepancies in non-emergency escort MOU and settlement, retaliation in custody augmentation, and denial of data requests related to roster rights. Filing is motivated by the need to protect Union members' rights, ensure adherence to contractual obligations, address challenges in accessing information, rectify disparities in working conditions, and preserve the Union's capacity to represent its members effectively. This action aims to promote fairness and foster a balanced and collaborative labor-management relationship.</p>

		<p>Revoking Roster Access as Retaliation</p>
</div>
	<p>The Union's request for Lieutenant access to the roster program for monitoring mandate passes during Labor-Management Relations (LMR) was met with the immediate revocation of Union Officials' access by management. This development underscores a potential clash between the Union and the agency, raising concers about transparency and collaboration. Such actions, if perceived as limiting the Union's ability to fulfill its role, may be seen as an adversarial move in the ongoing dynamics between the Union and agency.</p>
