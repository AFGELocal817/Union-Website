	<p>Grievance Process</p>
	</div>

	<hr>
	<div class="body-center">
	<p>Meal Period FLSA</p>
</div>

<p>This grievance addresses the Agency's failure to afford the mandated 30-minute duty-free, unpaid lunch break to daywatch custody staff in the majority of posts. Master Agreement Article 18, Section a. states: "The basic workweek will consist of five (5) consecutive workdays. The standard workday will consist of eight (8) hours with an additional thirty (30) minute non-paid, duty-free lunch break. However, there are shifts and posts for which the normal workday is eight (8) consecutive hours without a non-paid, duty free lunch break." By the agency failing to provide the built in lunch break they have violated the Master Agreement.</p>

	<div class="body-center">
	<p>Custody Untimely Payment of Overtime</p>
</div>

<p>This grievance pertains to the delayed payment of overtime, as the agency neglected to promptly compensate custody staff for overtime worked during the respective pay period. Consequently, this oversight led to a cascading effect, resulting in exorbitant taxation of overtime when it was eventually dispersed in the subsequent pay period.</p>

		<hr>
	<div class="body-center">
	<p>Unfair Distribution of Overtime in Medical</p>
</div>

<p>The agency has not implemented a comprehensive and equitable procedure for nursing staff to enroll in overtime opportunities, resulting in a lack of fair and standardized access to such opportunities for all personnel.</p>

		<hr>
	<div class="body-center">
	<p>Pulling Officers from Quarterly Bid Posts</p>
</div>

<p>This grievance has been initiated in response to Lieutenants reassigning officers from their designated posts. For instance, the reassignment of an officer whose bid post is the Younity Unit to the Cardinal Unit. Subsequently, Lieutenants hire overtime for the vacated Younity Unit position. Article 18, Section r. states: "Normally, non probationary employees, other than those assigned to sick and annual relief, will remain on the shift/assignment designated by the quarterly roster for the entire roster period. When circumstances require a temporary [less than five (5) working days] change of shift or assignment, the Employer will make reasonable efforts to assure that the affected employee's days off remain as designated by the roster." The Union acknowledges there are instances where the agency may need to pull officers from quarterly bid posts. However, without good cause this undermines officer's right to seniority and the Union cannot abide by that practice.</p>

		<hr>
	<div class="body-center">
	<p>Untimely Discipline</p>
</div>

<p>The Union presently has three grievances related to delayed disciplinary actions, with many more imminent. The rationale is straitforward: the disciplinary process should be expeditious. While acknowledging the unique aspects of each case and the time required for investigations, a three-year or more duration for the agency to determine appropriate discipline is deemed unrealistic and is seen as punitive rather than corrective. This extended timeline unfairly leaves bargaining staff in a state of uncertainty, impacting their chances for promotions and other opportunities.</p>

		<hr>
	<div class="body-center">
	<p>Union Discrimination Temporary Promotion</p>
</div>

<p>This grievance was lodged after a Union member was overlooked for a temporary promotion soley due to their active role in the Union. Management sought to compel this individual to relinquish all their Union rights and responsibilities as a prerequisite for consideration for the promotion.</p>

		<hr>
	<div class="body-center">
	<p>Union Official Representation FLSA</p>
</div>

<p>The agency placed a requirement on the Union to provide representation for a bargaining unit staff member. The representational duties took place outside of the representatives normal hours of work. The Warden authorized overtime compensation if the representative agreed to conduct the representation at the desired time. In an effort to prevent unecessary schedule adjustments the representative agreed and conducted the represenational business. Upon the typical pay period the representative became aware they were not compensated as the Warden directed. Requesting resolution the Warden reaffirmed the responsibility to compensate the representative. Ongoing the agency has continued to process the represenatives overtime pay. This representative has been denied the right to utilize time off awards and the use of official time on several occasions as well. The Union has a statutory obligation to provide represenation and it will not tolerate an agency who seeks to undermine bargaining unit staff's right to have represenation.</p>

	<div class="body-center">
	<p>Activities Lieutenant Overtime Distribution</p>
</div>

<p>The Union submitted this grievance on behalf of all eligible bargaining unit staff, objecting to the agency's exclusive allocation of overtime opportunities as Lieutenants to select individuals. The Union contends that this unequal distribution of Custody overtime creates an unjust disparity, denying the same opportunities to all bargaining unit employees. The Master Agreement Article 18, Section p. 1. states: "When management determines that it is necessary to pay overtime for positions/assignments normally filled by bargaining unit employees, qualified employees in the bargaining unit will receive first consideration for these overtime assignments, which will be distributed and rotated equitably among bargaining unit employees."</p>

		<hr>
	<div class="body-center">
	<p>UNICOR Quarterly Bid</p>
</div>

<p>The Union contends that the agency's recurrent neglect in conducting quarterly bids infringes upon the rights of bargaining unit employees. Without a Union waiver and no ongoing bid, the Union insists that employees with the UNICOR Accounting Technician role deserve the chance to bid for assignments in both Accounts Payable and Accounts Receivable. The Union argues for this quarterly bidding opportunity, citing the identical nature of the position descriptions in both departments. Furthermore, the Union asserts that this failure to conduct regular bids violates the Master Agreement Article 18, Section f.: "Roster committees outside the Correctional Services department will be formed to develop a roster unless mutually waived by the department head and the Union. It is recommended that the procedures in Section d. be utilized. These rosters will be posted three (3) weeks prior to implementation. Copies will be given to the local President or designee at the time of posting."</p>
