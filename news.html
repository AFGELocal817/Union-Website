            <p>The Union is not Gone</p>
        </div>

        <div class="body">
            <br>
            <p>The American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) and its Council of Prison Locals (CPL-33) are engaged in a critical legal battle to overturn the administration's recent action to strip collective bargaining rights from over 30,000 federal correctional officers and staff within the Bureau of Prisons (BOP)..</p>
            <p>On September 25, 2025, the BOP formally announced the termination of its Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) with CPL-33, claiming the agency must be excluded from labor relations statutes on the grounds of "national security." CPL-33 and AFGE National have vowed to use every available tool, legal and legislative, to fully restore the rights of our members.</p>
            <p>The Core of the Legal Challenge: Beyond Executive Authority The union's litigation is built on two primary legal claims that challenge the very foundation of the Executive Orders (EOs) used to justify the BOP’s action:</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="body-bold">
            <p>1. Statutory Overreach (Ultra Vires Action)</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="body">
            <p>AFGE argues the President exceeded the narrow authority granted by Congress in 5 U.S.C. 7103(b), which permits exclusions only if an agency's "primary function" is intelligence or national security work.</p>
            <p>The Union's Argument: The BOP's primary mission is custodial and correctional, not national security. The administration's attempt to apply this exemption broadly to the entire agency, including thousands of correctional officers, food service workers, and support staff, is an illegal distortion of the statute.</p>
            <p>The Judicial Precedent (Initial Wins): Federal district courts, such as Judge Paul Friedman (D.D.C.) in related union cases, have ruled that the administration’s use of the national security exemption against unions was "clearly ultra vires" (beyond legal authority), finding that the President did not make the individualized, factual determinations required by law.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="body-bold">
            <p>2. First Amendment Retaliation</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="body">
            <p>Union lawsuits also assert that the Executive Order is unconstitutional retaliation against federal employees for exercising their protected right to organize and publicly criticize administration policies.</p>
            <p>The Claim: The EOs and accompanying White House statements, which have targeted "hostile federal unions," are evidence that the true motive is to silence the voice of organized labor, not enhance national security.</p>
            <p>Judicial Finding: Judge James Donato (N.D. Cal.) previously granted a preliminary injunction in a coalition lawsuit (AFGE v. Trump) based on a finding that the unions raised a "serious question" as to whether the executive action was illegal retaliation.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="body-bold">
            <p>Current Status: The Fight Continues Despite Implementation</p>
        </div>

        <div class="body">
            <p>While AFGE and its coalition partners have secured key victories in the district courts, federal appellate courts have generally stayed (paused) these injunctions, deferring to the Executive Branch on national security matters.</p>
            <p>Impact on BOP: This has allowed the BOP to proceed with the cancellation of the CPL-33 Collective Bargaining Agreement. Our members are temporarily deprived of the contractual protections—including safeguards on staffing levels, disciplinary procedures, and workplace safety—that are critical for working in the dangerous federal prison environment.</p>
            <p>The Path Forward: The litigation is far from over. AFGE is aggressively pursuing the underlying case on its merits to win a permanent ruling that the Executive Order is unlawful. A final victory will force the reinstatement of the CBA and restore full union rights to all affected members.</p>
            <p>We will not stand by while the rights of our members are stripped away. We are prepared to take every legal and legislative action necessary to protect our contract and the employees who put their lives on the line every day.</p>
            <p>Stay informed and stand united! Your membership and solidarity are the greatest strength in this fight. Contact your local CPL-33 representative for specific guidance on how your workplace is being managed under current BOP policy.</p>
